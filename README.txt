NOTE:
Because we are using our own free tier of Render, it takes a second to warm up. So, before launching our website, click on the backend 
link and wait until the backend is running (if someone hasn't been running the server for a while it times out). The text on the backend 
link will say "Backend has loaded!" when it is ready to go, then click on the main link! :)
